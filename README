Since you need to use sudo and change some file manually, I cannot provide a bash for you to have a quick setup. Just follow the instructions below:

1. Install nodejs:
	- sudo apt install curl
	- curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash -
	- sudo apt install nodejs  
	- sudo npm install -g serve

2. Setup the website code and package
	- git clone https://github.com/tianmul/cs1320Final.git
	- cd cs1320Final/my_react_app/
	- npm install

3. Change the config file:
   Change address in config file to your server address (the public ip) with port 3001.
   If you want to use different port, go to cs1320Final/my_react_app/server/index.js and change the port written in the last line.

4. Build website:
	- npm run build
	
Before go to step 4, try to run "serve -s build" first to see which port your website is assigned.

4. Make website online:
	- nohup node ./server/index.js > serverLog &
	- nohup serve -s build > clientLog &
