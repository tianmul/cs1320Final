Since you may need to use sudo and change some file manually, we cannot provide a bash for you to have a quick setup. Just follow the instructions below (which is based on ubuntu server):

1. Install nodejs:
    - sudo apt install curl
    - curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash -
    - sudo apt install nodejs  
    - sudo npm install -g serve

2. Setup the website code and package
    - git clone https://github.com/tianmul/cs1320Final.git
    - cd cs1320Final/my_react_app/
    - npm install

3. Change the config file:
Change address in config file (cs1320Final/my_react_app/src/config.js) to your server address (the public ip) with port 3001. You can use multiple ip address to reduce the block possibility if you control multiple servers. 

If you use multiple servers option, choose one as your frontend website. For the rest servers, instead of going to step 4 and 5, just run 
- nohup node ./server/index.js > serverLog &
This will only start the backend side service instead of building both frontend and backend.

If you want to use a different port, go to cs1320Final/my_react_app/server/index.js and change the port written in the last line.


4. Build website:
    - npm run build
    
Before go to step 5, try to run "serve -s build" first and interrupt it (ctrl+c) to see which port your website will be assigned. (Normally, it should be port 5000).

5. Make website online:
    - nohup node ./server/index.js > serverLog &
    - nohup serve -s build > clientLog &

6. Exit ssh correctly
    - exit
    
Never Close The Terminal Directly Before You Exit The SSH To Server!
If you do this, the server will end the process and the website will down.
